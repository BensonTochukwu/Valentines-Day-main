            <h3>Dear Vanessa,</h3>
            <p>Being with you is like living in a dream where I don’t wanna wake up anymore. Never in my life that I imagine that there is a time that I would experience this kind of love.
             <br>The way you believe in me means everything to me. You see my goals, my dreams, the future I’m working toward, and you support me so much and stand beside me like it’s already real.. Sometimes you believe in me even more than I believe in myself, and that kind of love changes a person. It pushes me to do better. To be better for myself and for us.
             <br>Words honestly can’t measure how much I love you. I feel safe with you. Comfortable. Understood. I can be fully myself around you no pretending, no pressure just me. And you accept all of it. What makes us even more special is how deeply we connect. We think alike, we understand each other without having to over-explain. It feels like we’re on the same wavelength in life. Like we’re building something real, something steady, something lasting.
            I hope to celebrate more years with you. I hope to experience many things with you. Happy Valentine’s day, Baby.</p>
